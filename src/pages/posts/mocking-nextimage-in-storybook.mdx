# Mocking next/image in Storybook

February 23, 2021

As of the date I am writing this, [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) will break on any component that renders an Image component from [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image).

That kind of sucks, but that's alright. We can stub out the implementation of `next/image` with a mock in the meantime.

*Example stub implementation for next/image*
```javascript
// file: ./mocks/next/image.js

// Stub implementation of next/image. May need to be adapted depending on how you use next/image

import { createElement } from "react";

const Image = ({
	children,
	className,
	objectFit,
	objectPosition,
	src,
	style,
	...restProps
}) => {
	return createElement(
		"img",
		{
			className,
			src,
			style: {
				...style,
				objectFit,
				objectPosition
			},
			...restProps
		},
		children
	);
};

export default Image;
```

/* Example webpack config for storybook, using the next/image mock */
```javascript
// .storybook/main.js

const path = require("path");
const webpack = require("webpack");

module.exports = {
	/* ... */
	webpackFinal: (config) => {
		/**
		 * !HACK
		 * @description next/image doesn't work with storybook, so we are stubbing it with a mock
		 * @author David Lee
		 * @date February 23, 2021
		 */
		config.plugins.push(
			new webpack.NormalModuleReplacementPlugin(
				/^next\/image$/,
				path.resolve(__dirname, "./mocks/next/image.js")
			)
		);

		return config;
	}
};
```

Now, you can generate snapshots, visually test, make demos, etc. of your components that make use of `next/image`!

Happy coding! -- David Lee
