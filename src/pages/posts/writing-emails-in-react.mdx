# Writing Emails in React

February 18, 2021

If you've ever worked on HTML emails in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), there's a good chance you've worked with the [nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) module, and also maintained HTML templates written as template literals in JavaScript.

```typescript
const info = await transporter.sendMail({
	from: '"Fred Foo ðŸ‘»" <foo@example.com>', // sender address
	to: "bar@example.com, baz@example.com", // list of receivers
	subject: "Hello âœ”", // Subject line
	text: "Hello world?", // plain text body
	html: "<b>Hello world?</b>", // html body
});
```
*Example taken from [nodemailer.com](nodemailer.com)*

If you're a React + TypeScript developer like me, losing all of your static typing and intellisense feels like a hit to your developer experience (DX).

Not only that, but also [a lot of CSS has lackluster support on email clients](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/), which can lead you to writing complex HTML `table` structures to ensure consistent layouts.

```html
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0">
    <tr>
        <td colspan="3" height="120px">....</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="menu" valign="top">...</td>
        <td class="content" valign="top">...</td>
        <td class="aSide" valign="top">...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="3">...</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```
*Example taken from [smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/from-table-hell-to-div-hell](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/from-table-hell-to-div-hell/)*

If maintaining emails in this way is so unpleasant, how can we improve our DX?

## Introducing MJML-React

We've identified 2 pain-points of emails in Node.js thus far.
1. Template literals lose types and intellisense
2. Poor CSS support on email clients leads to messy table layouts

If you read the title to this post, you already know where this is headed.

[Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/) has created an open-source email framework called [MJML](https://mjml.io/) (Mailjet Markup Language) which provides an elegant abstraction over the `table` layouts above, as well as many ready-made components to use.

```html
<mjml>
  <mj-body>
    <mj-section>
      <mj-column>
        <mj-image width="100px" src="https://mjml.io/assets/img/logo-small.png"></mj-image>
        <mj-divider border-color="#F45E43"></mj-divider>
        <mj-text font-size="20px" color="#F45E43" font-family="helvetica">Hello World</mj-text>
      </mj-column>
    </mj-section>
  </mj-body>
</mjml>
```
*Example taken from [mjml.com](https://documentation.mjml.io/)*

*"Say goodbye to endless HTML table nesting or email client specific CSS. Building a responsive email is super easy with tags such as `<mj-section>` and `<mj-column>`"* (MJML documentation)

So we've solved pain-point (#2), but with this, our server's email code will look like this:

```typescript
const html: string = `
<mjml>
  <mj-body>
    <mj-section>
      <mj-column>
        <mj-image width="100px" src="https://mjml.io/assets/img/logo-small.png"></mj-image>
        <mj-divider border-color="#F45E43"></mj-divider>
        <mj-text font-size="20px" color="#F45E43" font-family="helvetica">Hello World</mj-text>
      </mj-column>
    </mj-section>
  </mj-body>
</mjml>
`;

const info = await transporter.sendMail({
	from: '"Fred Foo ðŸ‘»" <foo@example.com>', // sender address
	to: "bar@example.com, baz@example.com", // list of receivers
	subject: "Hello âœ”", // Subject line
	html
});
```

As you can see, we're still without our types or intellisense becauses everything is a string. Thankfully, with [React](https://reactjs.org/)'s `createElement` you can render any arbitrary XML tag, which makes integrating with MJML a breeze.

```tsx
import React, { createElement, FC } from "react";

export const MjmlButton: FC = ({ children, ...props }) => {
	return createElement("mj-button", props, children);
};

/* ... */

import mjml2html from "mjml";
import type { ReactElement } from "react";
import { renderToStaticMarkup } from "react-dom/server";

const render = (email: ReactElement): string => {
	return mjml2html(renderToStaticMarkup(email));
};

/* ... */

const email = (
	<Mjml>
		{/* ... */}
			<MjmlButton />
		{/* ... */}
	</Mjml>
);

const html: string = render(email);
```

You might say, "great, but wrapping every mjml component then typing all of the props seems like a pain".

## Open-source got you covered

Good thing we have [mjml-react](https://github.com/wix-incubator/mjml-react) and [@types/mjml-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/mjml-react) which does it all for us.

Now, all we need to do is install dependencies, define our API, and build out our emails:

```bash
npm install mjml mjml-react @types/mjml-react
```

```typescript
import { render } from "mjml-react";
import { createElement, ComponentType } from "react";
import { createTransport, SendMailOptions } from "nodemailer";

export const createEmailHtml = <P extends {}>(
	template: ComponentType<P>,
	props: P
): string => {
	const mjmlElement = createElement(template, props);

	const { html, errors } = render(mjmlElement);

	if (errors?.length) {
		throw new Error(errors[0]);
	}

	return html;
};

export const sendEmail = async (options: SendMailOptions) => {
	const transporter = createTransport({
		service: "gmail",
		auth: {
			user: process.env.EMAIL_SENDER_USER!,
			pass: process.env.EMAIL_SENDER_PASSWORD!
		}
	});

	return await transporter.sendMail({
		sender: process.env.EMAIL_SENDER_USER!,
		...options
	});
};
```

```tsx
// email-base component

import React, { FC } from "react";
import {
	Mjml,
	MjmlAll,
	MjmlAttributes,
	MjmlBody,
	MjmlBodyProps,
	MjmlBreakpoint,
	MjmlFont,
	MjmlHead,
	MjmlPreview,
	MjmlTitle,
	RequiredChildrenProps
} from "mjml-react";

export interface EmailBaseProps extends MjmlBodyProps, RequiredChildrenProps {
	breakpoint?: number;
	title: string;
	preview: string;
}

export const EmailBase: FC<EmailBaseProps> = ({
	breakpoint,
	children,
	title,
	preview,
	width,
	...restBodyProps
}) => {
	const fontFamily = "Roboto";
	const fontHref = `http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=${fontFamily}:400,100,100`;

	return (
		<Mjml>
			<MjmlHead>
				<MjmlTitle>{title}</MjmlTitle>
				<MjmlPreview>{preview}</MjmlPreview>
				<MjmlFont name={fontFamily} href={fontHref} />
				<MjmlAttributes>
					<MjmlAll fontFamily={fontFamily} fontSize={14} color="black" />
				</MjmlAttributes>
				{breakpoint && <MjmlBreakpoint width={breakpoint} />}
			</MjmlHead>
			<MjmlBody {...restBodyProps}>
				{children}
			</MjmlBody>
		</Mjml>
	);
};
```

```tsx
// email template to send to users

import { EmailBase } from "./email-base.component.tsx";
import { MjmlColumn, MjmlSection, MjmlText } from "mjml-react";
import React, { FC } from "react";

export interface HelloEmailProps {
	firstName: string;
	lastName: string;
}

export const HelloEmail: FC<HelloEmailProps> = ({
	firstName,
	lastName
}) => {
	const fullName: string = [firstName, lastName].join(" ");

	return (
		<EmailBase title="Hello!" preview="Hello from David Lee!">
			<MjmlSection>
				<MjmlColumn>
					<MjmlText>Hello {fullName}</MjmlText>
				</MjmlColumn>
			</MjmlSection>
		</EmailBase>
	);
};
```

Finally, you can send this email populating any data needed.

```typescript
import { createEmailHtml, HelloEmail, sendEmail } from "@myapp/server/email"; // Defined by us above

/* ... */

// Get user from your ORM
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id } });

if (!user) {
	return null;
}

const { email, firstName, lastName } = user;

const didSend: boolean =
	await sendEmail({
		to: email,
		subject: "Hello from David Lee",
		// With the magic of type generics, the props in parameter 2 have autocompletion
		html: createEmailHtml(HelloEmail, {
			firstName,
			lastName
		})
	})
	.then(() => true)
	.catch(() => false);

/* ... */
```

With this, we've now also solved pain-point (#1), since we now have types and intellisense provided by TypeScript on our IDE.

## Visual testing with Storybook

If you're someone who works a lot with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) you'll quickly find that `mjml-react` unfortunately does not work outside of Node.js. This is because, `mjml-react` depends on `mjml`, which depends on the `fs` module (at the time of writing this post).

We can get around this to some extent by generating our stories via a separate Node.js script every time we need to update our emails.

```tsx
// mount raw string html for rendering emails to storybook

import React, { FC } from "react";

export interface MjmlMounterProps {
	children: string;
}

export const MjmlMounter: FC<MjmlMounterProps> = ({ children }) => {
	return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: children }} >;
};
```

```tsx
// Script file to generate our email stories, for storybook to read

// All email template component types exported from an index.ts file
import * as templates from "@myapp/server/emails/templates";
import { stripIndent } from "common-tags";
import fs from "fs-extra";
import { render } from "mjml-react";
import path from "path";
import { ComponentType, createElement } from "react";

const toStory = (key: string, text: string) => stripIndent`
import { MjmlMounter } from "@myapp/server/emails";
import React from "react";

const html: string = \`${text}\`;

export default { title: "emails/${key}" };

export const Standard = () => <MjmlMounter>{html}</MjmlMounter>;

Standard.parameters = {
	layout: "fullscreen"
};
`;

const generateTemplates = () => {
	const emailHtmlDict: Record<string, string> = Object.keys(templates).reduce((acc, key) => {
		const template = templates[key];

		// This will fill your stories with your emails' default prop values
		const withDefaultProps = createElement(template);
		const { html, errors } = render(withDefaultProps, {
			minify: false
		});

		if (errors?.length) {
			throw new Error(errors[0]);
		}

		return { ...acc, [key]: html };
	}, {});

	// Prepare directory to generate stories into
	fs.ensureDirSync("outputDir");
	fs.emptyDirSync("outputDir");

	Object.keys(emailHtmlDict).forEach((key) => {
		const outputPath = path.join("outputDir", `${key}.stories.tsx`);
		const emailHtml = emailHtmlDict[key];

		fs.ensureFileSync(outputPath);
		fs.writeFileSync(outputPath, toStory(key, emailHtml), {
			encoding: "utf8",
			flag: "w"
		});
	});
};

generateTemplates();
```

```tsx
/* ... */

// Ensure that your prop types stay as non-nullable, so that defaults aren't used in real-use
export interface HelloEmailProps {
	firstName: string;
	lastName: string;
}

// Add default prop values for your generated stories
export const HelloEmail: FC<HelloEmailProps> = ({
	firstName = "Test",
	lastName = "User"
}) => {
	/* ... */
};
```

Looks unpleasant I know. Unfortunately, this is more-or-less my workflow at the time of writing this post.

At this point, you can launch your Storybook and run your script via [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) to see your email templates as stories.

Happy coding! -- David Lee
