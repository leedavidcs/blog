# TS Magic: Caller Configurable Return Types

February 21, 2021

If you're a user of [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), or wanted to create a function that changes its return-types based on the caller's parameters, this post is for you.

The [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) wizards over at Prisma have achieved very extensive TypeScript support on their PrismaClient, such that the return types for any CRUD can be narrowed depending on what the caller desires.

```markdown
...
model User {
	id        Int @id @default(autoincrement())
	firstName String
	lastName  String
	email     String
}
...
```

```typescript
/* ... */

// User contains only id, firstName and email. Not lastName
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
	where: {
		id: 0
	},
	select: {
		id: true,
		firstName: true,
		email: true
	}
});

/* ... */
```

In this example, the caller of `prisma.user.findUnique` has specified that they wish their return object to contain only `id`, `firstName` and `email`. And if you actually had this in your IDE and hovered over `user`, you would find that your intellisense will give you exactly this narrowed type.

How does Prisma do it?

## Type Generics Magic

*Disclaimer. I didn't actually look at Prisma's source code, so this may not be exactly the same. But the resulting TypeScript intellisense is identical enough.*

In the end, the devs at Prisma are just cleverly using TypeScript's [type generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html). And it's something you can easily add to your functions in your projects too!

```typescript
/* ... */

// Specify a super-set to the key-set you wish to filter from.
// This example is the broadest key-set you can select
type KeyOfType = string | number | symbol;

// Simulate Prisma's parameters, passing the key-set as a generic to be inferred
type FindUniqueParams<TKeys extends KeyOfType> = {
	where: { id: 0 };
	select?: { [key in TKeys]: true };
};

// The definition of a findOne query on entity type T
// Once the T generic is passed in, TKeys will be inferred to be the key-set of T
// And the return type will be the narrowed prop-set of the T type
type FindUniqueQuery<T extends Object> = <TKeys extends keyof T>(
	params: FindUniqueParams<TKeys>
) => Promise<{ [Prop in TKeys]: T[Prop] } | null>;

// Example type, taken from above
type User = {
	id: number;
	firstName: string;
	lastName: string;
	email: string;
};

const findUniqueUser: FindUniqueQuery<User> = async (params) => {
	return await Promise.resolve(
		Object.entries({
			id: 0,
			firstName: "John",
			lastName: "Doe",
			email: "johndoe@domain.com"
		})
			.filter(([key]) => !params.select || params.select[key])
			.reduce((acc, [key, value]) => ({ ...acc, [key]: value }), {} as any)
	);
};

// Simulated Prisma client
const prisma = {
	user: {
		findUnique: findUniqueUser
	}
};

/* ... */

// Hovering over user1 will show all props in TypeScript
const user1 = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: 0 } });

// Hovering over user2 will show id, firstName and email props in TypeScript
const user2 = await prisma.user.findUnique({
	where: { id: 0 },
	select: {
		id: true,
		firstName: true,
		email: true
	}
});

/* ... */
```

Congrats! Now you've improved your function to return a narrowed type, making your DX even better in the future!

Happy coding! -- David Lee
